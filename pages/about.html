        <p class="content">Hey,my name is Fiza. I'm from India and was brought up in Ludhiana, a city in the province of Punjab. I was born on 26 August,2003. My interests are to read books and play badminton. I have oped for Interactive Media Design at Algonquin. I always wanted to do something in digital media and luckily I got this wonderful course. I have always aspired to pursue careers in Digial Graphics and Web Designing. I used to attend Information Technology workshops in school and I became quite interested in it. I felt like I can professionally do something in this field and that is the reason I took Interactive Media Design</p>
